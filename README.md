# Bundesliga-Database-Management-System

The Bundesliga Database Management System (DBMS) is a project designed to understand the analysis of football-related data within the German Bundesliga for the 2018-19 season. This comprehensive system serves as a centralized hub for organizing, accessing, and analyzing diverse datasets, ranging from player profiles to match statistics.

It uses Python-Flask and Pyscopg2 along with PostgreSQL and pgAdmin for creating the database schema. The visual representation for the data is provided through HTML templates, that will be rendered using Flask.
